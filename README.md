# Smart-tickets

Membran Smart-Tickets provides a platform for the management and sales of tickets. 

###### The dApp focuses on these main elements:

  - Using the blockchain to achieve consensus on the validity of ticket transactions in a distributed manner
  - Leveraging smart contracts to automate the creation of events, and manangement of the tickets associated to a particular event
  - Provide high flexibility in the creation and operation of such events
  - Low costs and fees compared to existing ticketing solutions on the market today
  - High reliability and availability in terms of accessing and interacting with the event sales due to the distributed nature of blockchain + smart contracts
  - Reduction of second-hand market profiting and ticket fraud

# Roadmap
### Initial Smart Contract Work
- Implement creation of events
- Allow promoter to approve certain buyers as approved buyers
- Implement sectioning of states in the contract into "phases", this allows the contract to resemble different timeframes of an event
- Be able to buy tokens that resemble tickets as the approved buyer / customer

### Initial UI work 
- Be able to see all of user's current wallet addresses and their ether balances
- Be able to create an event as a promoter on the UI
- Be able to view details of the event after it is created
- Be able to allocate different ticket types after creation as the promoter with their price/type/fee
- Be able to approve buyers from the UI
- End consumers should be able to buy tickets from either the promoter or approved buyer 
- Approved buyers should be able to buy tickets from the promoter and set their own markup
