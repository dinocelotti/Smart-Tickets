                            Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: The leg is good. It'll bleed plenty and we avoid any unnecessary organs.  Vault Guard: I was thinking more of a graze.  Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: No. You don't want it to look like you just gave up.  Vault Guard: No. I get that!

Malcolm Reynolds: Define "interesting."  Hoban 'Wash' Washburn: [Deadpan] Oh God, oh God, we're all gonna die.  Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: [Grabs PA microphone] This is the captain. We're having a little problem with our entry sequence, so we may experience some slight turbulence and then... explode.  [Hangs up microphone]  Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: Can you shave the vector?  Hoban 'Wash' Washburn: I'm doing it, it's not enough.  Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: Well, just get us on the ground.  Hoban 'Wash' Washburn: That part'll happen pretty definitely.
